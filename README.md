# Effective_To-Do
This a windows app that is extremely fast and minimal, it's a to-do list and it does it better than anyother program! If you like reliable and efficient programs that also take minimal cpu and ram usage, this program size is about 150 kb so any computer and run it, and run it without waiting!

# How to get it?
You will need a c++ compiler of the sort, for windows I feel CLion or Visual Studio are the best options out right now. An even more simple way would to use g++ compiler, this way you dont have a program you dont need. In the future I will learn how to upload it as a .exe file, but for now I will keep it as is so anyone can get a copy. 

# Why should I compile it when I can just download it?
It is good for everyone to as least know how to compile the program, and maybe you might get the coding bug for a bit!
